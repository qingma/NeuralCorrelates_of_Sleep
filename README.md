Note: The main analytical methods used in this study are sCCA and hierarchical clustering. 
The sCCA analysis was primarily adapted from the code provided by Xia et al. (2018). For a complete set of analysis steps, please visit https://github.com/cedricx/sCCA/tree/master/sCCA/code/final. 
Thus, this repository contains codes for hierarchical clustering for your reference.
